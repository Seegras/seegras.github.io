## Config-Management-Abstract
Infrastructure as code(ified)

---

## Why?

* Documentation is hard to maintain
* Machine readability
* We have Standards. Many of them. Different ones
* Reproduceability
* Replayability
* Backup
* Versioning

---

## How?

---

* As a diff?
* A definition of the complete system?
* A definition of important parts?

---

## Caveats

* Diff
  * Outcome may vary
* Complete Definition
  * Must be adapted frequently
  * Becomes a (security-) liability
* Part Definition
  * Subject to changes in un(der)defined parts

---
## What?

* Configs
* Secrets?
* Packages
* Operating Systems
* Connections and Network
* Hardware Definitions

---

## More?

* Monitoring as the unit-test of engineering
* Staging environments
* Continuous Integration
* Orchestration
